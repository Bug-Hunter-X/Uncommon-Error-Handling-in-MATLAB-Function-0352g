This repository contains a MATLAB function that demonstrates an uncommon error handling scenario.  The function `myFunction.m` performs a simple calculation, but it includes explicit error checking. If the input is negative, an error is thrown. A `try-catch` block is used to gracefully handle this error and prevent the program from crashing. The `bugSolution.m` shows an improved version of the function.

The purpose of this example is to highlight the importance of robust error handling in MATLAB code, particularly for functions that might be called by other functions or scripts.
